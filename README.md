# Portfolio
Initial Portfolio for a sample of work with the design of both data communication and visualization, display are from coding and designed with customers on free tools with online and local database and API communication for real-time statistics and stages messages. There are more applications working in Crytal reports, online courses, IBM Cognos, and similar, Report tools but they are all repeats and designed by products. This portfolio displays my own codes and UX-UI-designed skills with coding migrations from Tomcat to IBM WebSphere, Statistics server communication for data designs that will use customer display templates, or my own design later.
